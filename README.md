# UnityObjExporter
For the guys like me that use unreal and unity. A script to export unity mesh to Wavefront Object.

Because I am using it a lot this days, I will be givin support to this script. And I will add more functionality when are needed. But for now as an MVP do his work
  
You must place the script in a folder named Editor in your project's Assets folder for it to work properly.

Select an object in the scene hierarchy or a prefab in your project and then choose ```File -> Export -> Wavefront OBJ```. Follow the save-file dialog to name and locate the intended exported .OBJ file.
A second option, ```File -> Export -> Wavefront OBJ (No Submeshes)```, will export the entire GameObject hierarchy as a single mesh. Use this option if you want to combine a prefab or object into a single mesh.

#Support

 2. Unity 4
